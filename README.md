# News-Website
The Live News App is a responsive web application that displays the latest news headlines in real-time using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It integrates with a third-party news API (like NewsAPI.org) to fetch and render current news articles from various categories such as general, technology, sports, business, and health.
